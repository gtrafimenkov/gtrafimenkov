# Dabbling in Rust

I've had a chance to write a small program in Rust and compare
that experience with writing the same program in other languages.

Here are my thoughts about Rust.

Pros:
- the tooling is top notch; cargo is very good
- documentation is very good
- editor support (Visual Studio Code) is good, but not excellent

Cons:
- Rust might be a good choice to use for system programming instead
  of C or C++, but for general programming it is too complex
- the standard library is small; one have to rely on open source libraries
  of various quality

For my projects Rust is not a great choice.
